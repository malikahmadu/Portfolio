Hi, I’m **Malik Ahmadu** — a **Computer Science student at the University of Houston**, graduating in **May 2026**.

I’m interested in how software systems are designed, built, and improved in real-world settings. My experience spans **software development, data analysis, and IT systems support**, and I enjoy working across the full stack — from writing code and analyzing data to understanding how systems behave in production environments.

Background
======
I’m currently completing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science, where I’ve built a strong foundation in **algorithms, data structures, databases, operating systems, and statistics**. Alongside coursework, I focus on applying these concepts through hands-on projects and professional experiences.

I’ve worked in both **technical support** and **analytics-focused roles**, which has shaped how I approach problem-solving: I value reliability, clarity, and solutions that are practical for the people using them.


Interests
======
My technical interests include:
- Software engineering and full-stack development  
- Data analysis and predictive modeling  
- System reliability and technical troubleshooting  
- Building tools that turn data into actionable insight  

I enjoy projects that require learning new tools, connecting multiple systems together, and iterating toward cleaner, more maintainable solutions.
